title: "EMODnet Biology Geospatial R Tutorials"
---

## Welcome

Learn how to access and analyze marine biological and environmental data from [EMODnet](https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/en/biology) using R. These hands-on tutorials guide you through real-world marine spatial analysis workflows, from accessing data via web services to creating publication-ready visualizations.

Whether you're investigating marine protected areas, exploring species distributions, or analyzing biodiversity change, these tutorials provide reproducible code and practical examples you can adapt to your own research questions.

## New to geospatial analysis?

If you're unfamiliar with spatial data concepts, coordinate systems, or the difference between vector and raster data, start with our [**Geospatial Concepts**](concepts.qmd) page.

## What You'll Learn

These tutorials demonstrate how to:

-   **Access marine data programmatically** using EMODnet's web services (WFS and WCS)
-   **Work with vector data** representing species occurrences, habitat boundaries, and human activities
-   **Analyze raster data** including bathymetry, species distributions, and environmental variables
-   **Integrate multiple data sources** from EMODnet, Copernicus Marine Service, and trait databases
-   **Apply spatial operations** such as intersection, masking, and point extraction
-   **Visualize spatial patterns** relevant to marine conservation and management

By the end of these tutorials, you'll be able to independently access, analyze, and visualize EMODnet data for your own marine research questions.
