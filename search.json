    "section": "Web Services for Spatial Data",
    "text": "Web Services for Spatial Data\n\nWhat is a Web Service?\nA web service is a standardized protocol that allows software applications to communicate with databases over the internet. In the context of spatial data, web services provide programmatic access to spatial databases - you send a request (e.g., “give me species observations in this bounding box”) and the service queries its database and returns the data.\nEssentially, web services are spatial databases + standardized communication protocols that let you query and retrieve data through HTTP requests instead of needing direct database access.\nKey benefits:\n\nProgrammatic access - Query data directly from R without manual downloads\nSelective retrieval - Request only specific regions, time periods, or attributes\nAlways current - Access the latest data without managing file versions\nReproducible - Your code documents exactly what data was retrieved\nEfficient - Download only what you need, reducing bandwidth and storage\n\n\n\nHow Web Services Work\nFigure 2 illustrates the typical workflow when accessing EMODnet data through web services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    A[Your R Script] --&gt;|HTTP Request&lt;br/&gt;bbox, layer, filters| B[EMODnet WFS/WCS Server]\n    B --&gt;|Query| C[(Spatial Database)]\n    C --&gt;|Matching Data| B\n    B --&gt;|Response&lt;br/&gt;GeoJSON/GeoTIFF| A\n    A --&gt;|Load into| D[R Object&lt;br/&gt;sf or terra]\n\n    style A fill:#e1f5ff\n    style B fill:#fff4e1\n    style C fill:#f0f0f0\n    style D fill:#e1f5ff\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Web service request flow from R to EMODnet data services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOGC Standards and Spatial Data Types\nThe Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has developed different standard protocols optimized for different types of spatial data. The protocols, underlying database technologies, and data formats all differ based on whether you’re working with vector or raster data.\nEMODnet provides two primary types of OGC-compliant geospatial web services, each designed for a specific spatial data type:\n\n\nWFS (Web Feature Service)\nWFS delivers vector data - discrete geographic features with attributes.\nKey characteristics:\n\nReturns features in formats like GeoJSON or GML\nSupports spatial and attribute filtering\nAllows querying specific areas or feature properties\nIdeal for points, lines, and polygons\n\nIn R: Use the emodnet.wfs package to access WFS services. The package simplifies discovering available layers, filtering by extent or attributes, and retrieving data as sf objects.\nExample WFS data from EMODnet:\n\nSpecies occurrences and distributions\nMarine protected area boundaries\nInfrastructure features\nHabitat polygons\n\n\n\nWCS (Web Coverage Service)\nWCS delivers raster data - gridded coverage representing continuous variables.\nKey characteristics:\n\nReturns coverage in formats like GeoTIFF\nSupports spatial and temporal subsetting\nCan extract specific bands from multi-band datasets\nIdeal for environmental layers and modeled surfaces\n\nIn R: Use the emodnet.wcs package to access WCS services. The package handles coverage discovery, spatial/temporal subsetting, and returns data as terra raster objects.\nExample WCS data from EMODnet:\n\nBathymetric depth models\nSpecies abundance and diversity grids\nHabitat suitability models\nGridded biodiversity metrics\n\n\n\nAdvantages of Web Services\nCompared to direct file downloads, web services offer:\n\nOn-demand access - Get only the data you need, when you need it\nSpatial filtering - Request data for specific regions using bounding boxes\nTemporal subsetting - Extract data for particular time periods\nAlways current - Access the latest data without managing downloads\nReproducibility - Script your data access for transparent, repeatable workflows"

    "section": "Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)",
    "text": "Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)\nA Coordinate Reference System defines how coordinates relate to locations on Earth’s surface. Understanding CRS is essential for accurate spatial analysis.\n\nThe Challenge: From 3D Earth to 2D Maps\nEarth is a three-dimensional sphere, but maps and computer screens are two-dimensional. Think of trying to peel an orange and flatten the peel completely - you can’t do it without distorting, stretching, tearing, or overlapping parts of it. This is the fundamental challenge of cartography.\nProjections are different methods of “peeling and flattening” Earth’s surface. Just as there are many ways you could cut and flatten an orange peel (peel it in strips, cut it into wedges, try to keep it in one piece), there are many different projection methods, each making different choices about:\n\nWhere to cut (what regions to split)\nWhat to stretch (which areas get distorted)\nWhat to preserve (angles, areas, distances, or shapes)\n\nThere is no perfect solution - every projection sacrifices something. This is why dozens of projections exist: each is optimized for different purposes and geographic regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteEPSG Codes\n\n\n\nThroughout this page, you’ll see CRS referenced by EPSG codes (e.g., EPSG:4326, EPSG:3857). EPSG stands for the European Petroleum Survey Group (now maintained by the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers), which created a standardized registry assigning unique numeric codes to coordinate reference systems. These codes provide an unambiguous way to specify which CRS you’re using.\n\n\n\n\nGeographic vs Projected CRS\nGeographic Coordinate Systems (Unprojected)\nGeographic CRS don’t actually “flatten” Earth - they describe locations on the 3D spheroid surface using angles (latitude and longitude in degrees). Think of this as leaving the orange intact and describing locations by their angular position from the center.\n\nExample: WGS84 (EPSG:4326) (Figure 3 (a)) - Most common for global marine data and default for EMODnet services\nUnits in degrees, not meters\nGood for storing and sharing data globally\nNot suitable for measurements - a degree of longitude represents different distances at different latitudes (degrees get closer together near the poles)\n\nProjected Coordinate Systems\nProjected CRS actually perform the “flattening” using mathematical transformations. Each projection is a different flattening method with different trade-offs:\n\nWeb Mercator (EPSG:3857) (Figure 3 (b)) - “Peels the orange” by stretching areas increasingly toward the poles. Preserves angles (conformal projection), which historically made it invaluable for maritime navigation - sailors could plot a straight line between two points and maintain a constant compass bearing throughout their journey. However, this comes at the cost of severely distorting areas at high latitudes. Used by most web maps because it makes the whole world fit in a square.\nUTM zones (e.g., EPSG:32631 for UTM 31N) - “Cuts the orange” into 60 vertical strips (zones), each 6° of longitude wide. Each strip is flattened with minimal distortion within that zone. Excellent for regional analysis.\nLambert Azimuthal Equal Area (EPSG:3035) (Figure 3 (c)) - “Flattens the orange” while preserving area relationships. A 100 km² habitat appears as 100 km² on the map, regardless of location. Essential for statistical analyses involving area.\nLocal projections - Optimized flattening methods for specific countries or regions, minimizing distortion in areas of interest.\n\nFigure 3 compares these three coordinate reference systems using Europe and Greenland to illustrate the dramatic differences in how projections distort geographic features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) WGS84 (EPSG:4326) - Unprojected geographic CRS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Web Mercator (EPSG:3857) - Projected CRS with severe distortion at high latitudes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (EPSG:3035) - Projected CRS preserving area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Comparison of Europe and Greenland in three different coordinate reference systems. Notice how Greenland’s size changes dramatically across projections - Mercator makes it appear huge through vertical stretching, while LAEA shows its true relative size.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy This Matters for Marine Spatial Analysis\n\nMeasurements require projected CRS - You can’t accurately calculate distances or areas in degrees (geographic CRS). You need a projection that converts to meters.\nChoose projections for your region - A projection optimized for Europe will distort tropical regions. Use UTM zones for your study area or regional equal-area projections.\nMatch your analysis goal - Use equal-area projections for habitat area calculations, equidistant projections for dispersal distance analyses, or conformal projections for angular relationships.\nAlignment is critical - All datasets in an analysis must use the same CRS, or features won’t align correctly.\n\n\n\nWorking with CRS in R\nBoth major R spatial packages provide CRS transformation functions:\n\nVector data (sf) - Use st_transform() to convert between coordinate systems\nRaster data (terra) - Use project() to reproject raster layers\n\nThe tutorials demonstrate when and how to transform between CRS for different types of spatial analyses."

    "section": "Common Spatial Operations",
    "text": "Common Spatial Operations\n\nVector Operations (sf)\n\nSpatial intersection - Identifies features that overlap spatially, returning the geometric intersection and combined attributes from both input layers. Useful for finding which features from different datasets occupy the same locations (e.g., protected areas intersecting with infrastructure).\nBuffering - Creates zones of specified distance around features, generating polygons that represent areas within a given radius. Essential for proximity analyses, such as identifying areas within a certain distance of sampling stations or evaluating buffer zones around sensitive habitats.\nSpatial joins - Combines features from two layers based on their spatial relationship (e.g., contains, intersects, within). Allows you to transfer attributes from one layer to another based on location, such as assigning habitat types to species occurrence points or aggregating observations within management zones.\nDistance calculations - Measures distances between features, either point-to-point or between features and geometries. Critical for analyses involving dispersal distances, connectivity assessments, or identifying nearest neighbors.\nArea and length measurements - Calculates geometric properties of features, providing area measurements for polygons and length measurements for lines. Required for quantifying habitat extent, assessing patch sizes, or measuring transect lengths.\n\n\n\nRaster Operations (terra)\n\nExtraction - Retrieves raster cell values at specified point locations or within polygon boundaries. Commonly used to extract environmental variables (depth, temperature, salinity) at species occurrence locations or calculate zonal statistics within habitat polygons.\nMasking - Restricts raster data to areas defined by a polygon or another raster, setting values outside the mask to NA. Useful for limiting analyses to specific regions such as marine protected areas, exclusive economic zones, or specific depth ranges.\nRaster algebra - Performs mathematical operations on raster layers, either within a single layer (e.g., unit conversions, transformations) or across multiple layers (e.g., calculating change between time periods, combining variables). Enables creation of derived metrics like biodiversity change or habitat suitability indices.\nAggregation and resampling - Changes raster resolution by combining or subdividing cells. Aggregation reduces resolution for computational efficiency or matching other datasets, while resampling adjusts resolution or aligns grids from different sources.\nFocal operations - Applies functions to neighborhoods of cells, such as calculating moving window statistics (mean, standard deviation) or smoothing. Used for identifying spatial patterns, creating terrain derivatives, or reducing noise in environmental data."

    "text": "Data Formats\nUnderstanding spatial data formats is important when working with web services, even through R packages. While the emodnet.wfs and emodnet.wcs packages handle data retrieval and automatically load results as R objects (sf for vector, terra for raster), the underlying format requested from the service can have significant practical implications:\nDownload speed and data size - Different formats have different compression and encoding schemes, affecting transfer time and bandwidth usage.\nGeometry types and plotting compatibility - Format choice affects what feature geometries are returned. For example, WFS services may return complex geometry types like MULTISURFACE in GML format, which cannot be easily plotted and require conversion to standard POLYGONs. Requesting GeoJSON format instead often returns simpler geometry types that integrate directly with plotting workflows.\nSaving data locally - After retrieving data from EMODnet, you may want to save it for archival, sharing with collaborators, or use in other software. Understanding format characteristics helps you choose the best option for your needs.\nThe tutorials demonstrate when and how to specify output formats to optimize your workflow.\n\nVector Formats\nGeoJSON (.geojson)\n\nText-based, human-readable\nWidely supported across platforms\nGood for web applications and data sharing\nDefault output from many WFS services\n\nShapefiles (.shp + supporting files)\n\nTraditional GIS format\nRequires multiple files (.shp, .shx, .dbf, .prj)\nWell-supported but has limitations (field name length, size limits)\n\nGeoPackage (.gpkg)\n\nModern, single-file format\nSupports multiple layers\nNo size limits\nRecommended for new projects\n\n\n\nRaster Formats\nGeoTIFF (.tif)\n\nIndustry standard for raster data\nEmbeds spatial reference information\nSupports multiple bands\nEfficient for large datasets\nDefault output from many WCS services\n\nNetCDF (.nc)\n\nMulti-dimensional arrays\nCommon for oceanographic and climate data\nHandles time series and multiple variables\nUsed by Copernicus Marine Service"

The blue rectangle shows the spatial extent that would be requested from a web service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Use Bounding Boxes?\nBounding boxes enable efficient spatial data retrieval by:\n\nReducing data transfer - Download only features or coverage within your study area\nImproving performance - Smaller data volumes mean faster processing and lower memory requirements\nFocusing analyses - Limit results to relevant geographic regions from the start\nReproducible workflows - Explicit spatial extent definitions make analyses transparent and repeatable\n\n\n\nBounding Boxes in EMODnet Services\nBoth WFS (vector) and WCS (raster) services accept bounding box parameters to spatially filter results. When querying EMODnet data through the emodnet.wfs and emodnet.wcs packages, you specify bounding boxes as numeric vectors with minimum and maximum coordinates in the appropriate coordinate reference system (typically WGS84 lon/lat for EMODnet services).\nThe tutorials demonstrate practical bounding box usage for retrieving EMODnet data in specific regions, from local study sites to broader management areas."
