title: "1: Protected Areas and Subsea Infrastructure"
subtitle: "Identifying Protected Areas Affected by Subsea Infrastructure in the North Sea"
difficulty: "Beginner"
time: "~45 minutes"
data-type: "WFS (vector)"
description: "Learn the fundamentals of accessing EMODnet WFS data by identifying marine protected areas that overlap with subsea infrastructure like pipelines and cables. This tutorial introduces spatial intersection operations and provides a foundation for marine spatial planning analyses."
