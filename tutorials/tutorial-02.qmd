## Tutorial Content

This tutorial is currently under development.

### What You'll Learn

- Understanding how to identify and retrieve relevant raster layers using `describe_coverages()`
- Using `emdn_get_coverage()` to download WCS data for a specific area and time
- Applying raster alignment, masking, and standardisation for comparative analysis
- Interpreting spatial patterns in relative abundance and their ecological relevance

### Data Sources

- **EMODnet Biology WCS:** Copepod relative abundance layers (*Acartia* spp., *Temora longicornis*, *Calanus finmarchicus*)
- **EMODnet Seabed Habitats WCS:** Plaice Essential Fish Habitat (nursery grounds) predictions (GRAY_INDEX band)

### Study Area

Eastern English Channel

**Bounding box:** xmin = 0.0, ymin = 49.5, xmax = 2.5, ymax = 51.0
