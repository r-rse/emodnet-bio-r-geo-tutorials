## Tutorial Content

This tutorial is currently under development.

### What You'll Learn

- Using `emdn_get_features()` to access spatiotemporal diversity metrics from EMODnet Biology (WFS)
- Using `emdn_get_coverage()` to retrieve raster bathymetry from EMODnet Bathymetry (WCS)
- Performing spatial joins and point-based extraction from raster datasets
- Visualising and summarising patterns of species gain/loss across depth gradients

### Data Sources

**WFS (vector):**
- **Layer ID:** `all_diversity_measures`
- **Source:** EMODnet Biology
- **Key variables:** Species loss, species gain, β-diversity, time periods

**WCS (raster):**
- **Layer ID:** `emodnet__mean_2020`
- **Source:** EMODnet Bathymetry
- **Description:** Mean depth (m), regularly gridded

### Study Area

North Sea

**Bounding box (WGS84):** xmin = 1.5, ymin = 53, xmax = 6.5, ymax = 58
