## Tutorial Content

This tutorial is currently under development.

### What You'll Learn

- Demonstrating combined use of emodnet.wfs, emodnet.wcs, and CopernicusMarine packages
- Retrieving and visualising body size traits for benthic species using trait databases
- Exploring trait–environment relationships across habitat types
- Practical geospatial workflows including raster extraction and spatial joins

### Data Sources

- **EMODnet WFS:**
  - `eb185_benthos_full_matched`: Benthic species records in the Aegean
  - `eu_seabed_habitats_2019`: Seabed habitat polygons
- **EMODnet WCS:**
  - `emodnet__mean_2020`: Bathymetry raster (mean depth of seafloor)
- **Copernicus Marine Service:**
  - `GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_PHY_001_030`: Bottom temperature and/or salinity reanalysis data
- **External Resources:**
  - **MOBS (Marine Organism Body Size) database**: [github.com/crmcclain/MOBS_OPEN](https://github.com/crmcclain/MOBS_OPEN)
